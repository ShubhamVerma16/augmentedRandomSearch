# augmentedRandomSearch
The project aims at unsupervised learning of an object by only using numpy.

Imports required - 

import os
import numpy as np
import gym
from gym import wrappers
import pybullet_envs

You will need to download and install Visual C++ Build Tools on this link:

https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

Basically Windows just needs this in the background to get the gym environments to work.

The main.py folder needs to be placed inside the PyBullet folder for the project to run.
You can downlaod the PyBullets folder from the below link:
